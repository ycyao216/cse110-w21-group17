### 2. Primary Means of Communication and Expectations
All members will be expected to check Discord, emails, and Slack messages from anyone in the group on a daily basis and respond in not more than 24 hours, or 48 hours before a deadline. Be sure to reach out on all three platforms and waiting an appropriate amount of time before deeming someone unreachable.

All members will inform the group at least one hour before missing any weekly meeting (but inform the group leaders as soon as possible). If any member is to miss a meeting, they are to share what they would have contributed in that meeting beforehand, read the meeting notes afterwards, and ask questions if the notes are not thoroughly understood.

### 3. Scheduling Meetings
Bi-weekly meetings, in PST ([zoom link](https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/96975473049) for both meetings)

Sundays 5-6 PM, PST

If for any reason a meeting is cancelled or the meeting time is changed, an announcement will be made to the team 48 hours before the original scheduled meeting time.

Similarly, newly created meetings will be announced to the team 48 hours before that meeting.

### 4. General Responsibilities for All Team Members
- Always treat other team members with respect
- Decisions will require a majority of 6 members
    - If someone is not present in a meeting but a decision is being made, that person will be messaged through Discord to be given a chance to provide input. If there is not a response by the time the decision needs to be made, the group will make the decision with the members present at the time.
    - Decisions that are not time-sensitive will be posted on Discord and people will have 48 hours to respond.
- Be sure to commit to completing allocated tasks and assisting others to meet deadlines
- Take interest other team members' work and share relevant information freely
- Focus on solving the actual problem rather than placing blame on others
- Be sure to admit to difficulties if they occur, and ask for help when needed
- Provide open communication with regards to progress
- All team members are responsible for knowing the contents of each meeting, and need to inform the group about mis-matching information logged in meeting notes. Promises made must be logged in meeting notes, and we will use meeting notes to track responsibilities. 
- Inform the team before making functionality changes to the repo (through pull requests or other communication methods).

### 5. Conflict Resolution
- If someone has an issue, they will take it up to the team leads first, and then team leads can decide if a team meeting is necessary or not (these meetings will follow standard meeting creation procedure).
- If that team meeting does not solve the issue, we may then bring the issue higher up to the TA or professor.

### 6. Expectations of TAs and Professor
If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the TAs or the professor, but the team will still be responsible for submitting completed assignments.

***This document is subject to change. Amendments need to be unanimously agreed upon, rather than majority vote. Because of this, there is no need to re-sign the contract upon amendment.***
